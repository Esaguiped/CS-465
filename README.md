Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

- **The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database so the data can be easier to understand, based on the way it's stored.**

Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

-**An example would be is that JSON presents itself in strings while Javascript is presented in objects. They work together because Javascript objects are stored in the backend and used depending on what the frontend is asking for.**

Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

**All of these are complicated to comprehend at times but with proper application and knowledge, I was able to understand how to build this project. Basically they all tie together and work in the application to ensure everything works the way it's intended**

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

**This course has helped me further my professional goals because I know what to do in a full stack development. Skills I've learned here will definitely help me if I have a job in the future that deals with full stack development**
